## 🔍 **Debugging Information**

### **Browser Console Errors**
Open browser DevTools (F12) and check for:
- `WebHID not supported` → Use Chrome/Edge/Opera
- `Device not found` → Check USB connection
- `Permission denied` → Grant device permissions
- `App not open` → Open Ethereum app on device

### **Device Status Indicators**
- 🟢 **Green**: Device ready and connected
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Device connected but app not open
- 🔴 **Red**: Device not connected or locked

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **For Consistent Connections**
- Always follow the same sequence: Connect → Unlock → Open App → Use Web App
